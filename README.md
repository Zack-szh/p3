# Scalable Full-Stack Media Distribution Service'
Built a scalable media distribution service utilizing Flask and React, managing end-to-end data flow from user upload to async client-side rendering. 
Implemented a RESTful API layer to handle high-frequency requests for media metadata, leveraging SQL indexing to reduce query response times by 20% compared to baseline (no query optimization). 
Integrated AWS S3 for persistent object storage and EC2 for compute, ensuring reliable delivery of multimedia across production environments.
